# Data Structures

## Array
- In computer science an array data structure or simply an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements
- These elements could be values or variables
- Each identified by an array index or key
- Arrays are stored in such a way that the position of each element can be computed from it's index
- The simplest form is linear array or a one-dimensional array

## Tree
- A widely used abstract data type or data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure 
- With a root value and sub-root of children with a parent node
- represented as a set of linked nodes

## Stack
- An abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with two principal operations
- push: which adds an element to the collection
- pop: which removes the most recent element that was not yet removed
- The order of which elements come off the stack gives rise to it's alternative name LIFO (last in first out)

## Queue
- An abstract data type where elements in the collection are kept in order, there are two operations
- enqueue : Adding elements to the end of the queue
- dequeue : Removing elements from the front of the queue
- A queue is a First In First Out (FIFO) data structure

## Graph
- Its an abstract data type that is meant to implement the directed and undireted graph concepts in mathematics in the field of graph theory
- Consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices

## Hash Table
- A data structure that implements an associative array data type, a structure that can map keys to values
- A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots from which the desired value can be found

## Linked List
- A linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory
- each element points to the next, a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence
- In it's most basic form, each node contains data and a reference or link to the next node in the sequence

## Heap
- A specialized tree based data structure, which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property
- If P is a parent node of C, then key (value of P) is greater than or equal to (in a max heap), or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key C
- The node at the top with no parent is called the root node
